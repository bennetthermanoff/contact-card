Route determines contact id, /:contactId

backend - no database, just 'contacts' folder containing contact card files, name of the file is the contactId/route.

This allows us to make qr codes to link to contact card, as well as the website has meaningful data. Allowing users to use their mobile phoneâ€™s browser history to keep track of who they saw.
